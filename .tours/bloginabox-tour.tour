This means that all of the dependencies -- ruby, jekyll, the right version of node, the tooling packages -- are all wrapped up in a container that you can open this code in. You can do that within VS Code, or you can do it via GitHub Codespaces and develop in the browser, all while getting the same consistent tooling.",
