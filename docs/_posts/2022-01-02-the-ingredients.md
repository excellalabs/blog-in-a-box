This project is created to use the following:

* **A dev container**. This will allow us to use VSCode to open this project within the dev container we've created, saving you a bunch of setup and hassle. It includes shortcut commands, recommended default extensions to make authoring easier, etc.
  * Alternatively, you can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and do this all in a web browser. The dev container can be used locally or in a browser. (cool, right?!)
  * Alternatively, you can open this on your local machine as long as you have the dependencies installed.
* **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** -- a popular static site generator
* **[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)** -- a great, clean Jekyll theme that is highly customizable
* **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** -- this is where we assume your site will be deployed. It is free and excellent.
