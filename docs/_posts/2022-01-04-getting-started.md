* Delete the `CNAME` file -- that one belongs to us so you'll have a conflict if you try to publish and it's still there. We'll walk through steps to set this up later.
* Update the name within your `devcontainer.json` file to match your blog's name.
* Go through the [Configuration Guide for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/), and update the `docs/_config.yml` file accordingly.
  * We've configured some sensible defaults and added comments where they might be helpful.
* As you go through the posts in the `_posts` directory, feel free to delete them so that they don't ship with your site.
* You may want to replace or delete the `/docs/favicon.ico` file, which is currently the Excella logo.
* You may want to set comments in `docs/_config.yaml` from `giscus` to `false` temporarily, until you follow the docs below to set up Giscus commenting.
