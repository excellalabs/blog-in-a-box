* A GitHub account (you can get one for free).
* Docker (if wanting to use the dev container on your local machine).
* If not using the dev container, you'll need Ruby and Node installed locally.
* A domain name. You don't strictly need one -- you could deploy to `yoursite.githubpages.io`, but we find that with a domain name things just feel snazzier. Prices vary by name. Sean likes [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) for low cost + ease of use. If you want to search for a name, you could try using [Domainr](https://domainr.com) and see what you come up with.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.
