:information_source: Have a challenge with any of this? [Let us know](https://github.com/excellalabs/blog-in-a-box/issues/new) and we'll help!

This can get a little tricky so we'll walk through this example with Namecheap and provide some screenshots.

* Add a file to the root of the repository called `CNAME`. The contents of the file should be the domain name or subdomain you're deploying to, e.g. `blog.mysite.com` or `bloginaboxdemo.com`.
* Save the file, commit it, and merge the change.
  * (are these terms completely unfamiliar? That's ok! Feel free to [create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/excellalabs/blog-in-a-box/issues/new) and we'll help you walk through it.)

Next up, it's time to Get the GitHub Pages settings in place.

* In your repository on GitHub, navigate to the `Settings` tab and click it.
* On the left-hand navigation, choose `Pages` for pages settings.
* From the `Source` drop-down, select the `main` branch. You can think of this branch like "production". Anything merged into it will get published (unless it's a future post).
* Change the `Folder` option from `/(root)` to `/docs` and click `Save`.
* Note: we're _not_ going to choose a theme, because we're already using a theme that comes bundled with our blog.

With those settings in place, next  we need to go to our domain registrar or the organization who handles DNS (in our example, we're using [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com), because Sean loves them.) We're going to follow the [GitHub Pages custom domain instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) here. The instructions below work if you're using an "apex" or "naked" domain, such as our `bloginaboxdemo.com` site. If you're using a sub-domain, follow the instructions at the above link. [Create an issue](https://github.com/excellalabs/blog-in-a-box/issues/new) if you get stuck, and we'll help you.

* Log into Namecheap and go to the domain's settings.
* Click the "Advanced DNS" button" to go to DNS settings
* If it's a new domain, remove any default DNS records that are there. Otherwise, be careful what you change (and feel free to ask us for help by [creating an issue](https://github.com/excellalabs/blog-in-a-box/issues/new)).
* For each of the IP Addresses [in the Apex domain instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain) (at the time, `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`):  
  * Create a new record, of type `A`.
  * Make the host `@` (which is short-hand for the "naked domain", or `yoursite.com`).
  * Make the value the IP address
  * Repeat for all IP addresses
* Click to save your changes.
* Next you'll likely want to create a `www` subdomain so that `www.yoursite.com` and `yoursite.com` go to the same place.
  * Create a new DNS record, of type `CNAME`. Set the host as `www`, and the value as `yourusername.github.io`. For example, this repo is hosted on the `excellalabs` org, so our value would be `excellalabs.github.io`.

Here's an example of how the DNS records might look:

![DNS records, both A and CNAME, for bloginaboxdemo.com](readme-images/DNSConfiguration_NakedDomainPlusWWW.png)

At this point, your DNS changes should be live soon (they take some time to propagate -- sometimes more than 24 hours). Then, your blog should be available at the URL you configured.

Now we can enforce `HTTPS`, which is important for the security of the web.

* Go back to the GitHub Pages settings
* Check the `Enforce HTTPS` option. You'll see a green checkmark after it automatically saves.
