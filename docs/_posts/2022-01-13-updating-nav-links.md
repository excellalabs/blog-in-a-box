:information_source: Have a challenge with any of this? [Let us know](https://github.com/excellalabs/blog-in-a-box/issues/new) and we'll help!

This blog setup uses the [minimal mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Minimal mistakers [uses a file in `_data/navigation.yml`](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/navigation/) to show top-level links to the site.

You can use relative or external links.

We created a default file for you in `_data/navigation.yml` -- feel free to edit it.
