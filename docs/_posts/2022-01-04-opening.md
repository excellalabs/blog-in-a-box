## Using VS Code and the Dev Container

* Ensure Docker is started on your machine
* Open The repository within VS Code on your machine.
* You may be prompted to reopen in the dev container. If prompted, do that.
* If not prompted, click in the bottom left corner (the green area) and select `Reopen in Container`.

## Using GitHub Codespaces

If GitHub Codespaces is enabled, you can open this project and code on it from directly within your web browser!

* Go to your repository on GitHub
* Click the green `<> Code` button
* Click the `Codespaces` tab
* Click `New codespace`

This will open a browser window that will work exactly as if you have a local VS Code instance.
