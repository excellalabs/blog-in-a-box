:information_source: Have a challenge with any of this? [Let us know](https://github.com/excellalabs/blog-in-a-box/issues/new) and we'll help!

Congratulations! At this point, following all of the steps, you likely have all the basics up and running.

So, what's next?

* You'll typically be writing your posts in Markdown, an amazing language for things like this once you're used to it. This tool uses what's called GitHub-flavored Markdown. Here's [a great, quick intro to GitHub Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d).
* The [Minimal Mistakes theme has great docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/). We recommend reading through all of the topics, where you'll learn about the theme and how to override it, great tricks for working with posts / pages / collections, different helpers and classes, etc.
* You may also want to read up on Jekyll via the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). This goes through some of the basic concepts that the blog engine uses, like front-matter, Liquid templates, includes, layouts, etc.
* Jekyll uses the Liquid template language; if you're digging deeper into layouts and includes, it might be beneficial to read the [Liquid docs](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

The above might seem like a lot, but we promise you won't need to master it to create great things.
