This is an [Excella Labs](https://excellalabs.com/) project. We created it because we love developers and modern delivery.

BlogInABox is a repository that aims to be a quick, all in one stop for someone to get a blog presence up and running.

It relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Theme, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting, and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for builds and automation.

We created it because we want you to be able to put your voice out there, because it's valuable.
