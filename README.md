## Q & A

### Why is the blog in a `/docs` folder?

GitHub Pages, where we presume you are deploying, has some rules for what can be deployed. If deploying from the main branch, you have two options: `(root)`, or the base directory of the repository, and `/docs`. In our case, we didn't want the other stuff in the root to get confused with the actual blog stuff, so we chose `/docs` because that's the name available that fits into our batteries-included setup with the least amount of fuss.

There are ways to customize this, particularly by using a `gh-pages` branch and creating a GitHub Action to push to it, but we figured that might be over-complicated. Feel free to reach out if you want to set that up and we may follow up with some more on this in the future.

### Why are there two `markdownlint` configuration files?

`.markdownlintrc` is for the GitHub Actions build step, and `.markdownlint.json` is for the VS Code extension that underlines issues. We'll see if we can combine them into one file, but that's why they exist currently.
